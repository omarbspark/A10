    <h1>API Practice</h1>
    <div id="data">Loading... <br> </div>
    <p> Initially the API was working and would insert 10 short 
    headers in lorum ipsum and then before submission I kept getting 
    a 404 error and have no idea why as I havent changed anything in my code. 
    </p>

    <p> Thus I will answer the questions on the hw with the assumption that
        it could be restored back to what it did initially. </p>

        <p> Description of API: The API I used for this assignment was a lorumip
            sum generator but "the one that doesnt suck" by the websites definition </p>

       <p> The api could be used with a basic call loripsum.net/api or if the user
        wanted something more specific the API allows you to add more parameters
        like links, unordered lists, block quotes, headers, and more as well
           as lengths of paragraphs and such. </p>

       <p> Website API was found: I found the api from this website: https://loripsum.net/
        and I found that website from here https://www.diycode.cc/projects/toddmotto/public-apis </p>

        <p>I used a GET request to get 10 short headers from the generator and insert
        them into the div that has the id "data." I then sent a request to the
        API at the end. </p>

    <p>Two Applications where the API would be useful:</p> 
            <p>1.) Filling in a general outline --> if you have constructed the
            design of a website and want to see how things look, you can 
            easily insert links, lists, numbers, text and others things from
            this API into your website. This gives you a gernal idea of how
            it would look in the current format you have once it's filled
                with the information you want to put in the website.</p>

           <p> 2.) Tutorial using API's: This API is pretty easy to use as there
            is no API key needed to access it. The URL api link is also very
            short. This API would be used best when conductiong a GET request
               tutorial as it gives very basic JSON data that can be parsed out.</p>
